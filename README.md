This is my read me now!

To do list
stochastic gradient descent, feedforward vs recurrent are both terms which might make our neural net a lot smarter

One of the big issues currently is we cannot move the data we have gotten into a neuralnetwork efficiently

We may want to consider using an outside module for our neuralnet, with more optimiztions, like Pylearn 2 or Tensorflow (we currently use sklearn)
